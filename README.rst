MockS3
======

Forked from `jserver/mock-s3`_, "A python port of Fake-S3_", with the intention of:

- Removing any non-standard-library dependencies (eg. Jinga2).
- Removing external dependencies (eg. Redis).
- Providing it as an installable module.
- Adding unit tests/BDD specs to ensure compatibility.

all for use with Continuous Integration servers.
